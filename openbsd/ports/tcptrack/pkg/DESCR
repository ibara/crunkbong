tcptrack displays the status of TCP connections that it sees on a given
network interface. tcptrack monitors their state and displays
information such as state, source/destination addresses and bandwidth
usage in a sorted, updated list very much like the top(1) command.

The filter expression is a standard pcap filter expression (identical to
the expressions used by tcpdump(8)) which can be used to filter down the
characteristics of TCP connections that tcptrack will see.
